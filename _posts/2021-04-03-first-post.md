This is my first post to Fatigue Failure, the successor to [Craic Propagation](https://craicpropagation.blogspot.com/).

I'm working my way through ["Deep Learning for Coders with fastai & PyTorch"](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1YW47LP5K9KRB&dchild=1&keywords=deep+learning+for+coders+with+fastai+and+pytorch&qid=1617480318&sprefix=deep+learning+for+coders+with+fa%2Caps%2C176&sr=8-1).
I'd like to learn neural networks, deep learning, and Jupyter notebooks.  This book and its accompanying videos are a great way to begin.
