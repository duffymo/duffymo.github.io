This is Fatigue Failure, the successor to [Craic Propagation](https://craicpropagation.blogspot.com/)

I set up this blog to work through ["Deep Learning for Coders with fastai & PyTorch" by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2MNBKBRD608GX&dchild=1&keywords=deep+learning+for+coders+with+fastai+and+pytorch&qid=1617478226&sprefix=deep+learning+for+coders+with+fas%2Caps%2C244&sr=8-1).
